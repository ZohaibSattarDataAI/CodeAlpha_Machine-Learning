# CodeAlpha_Machine Learning Internship Project

Welcome to the **CodeAlpha_Machine Learning** repository! This project is part of my internship at CodeAlpha, where I worked on hands-on machine learning applications, data preprocessing, and building predictive models using Python.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview

During this internship, I explored various **machine learning techniques** and implemented them on real-world datasets. The goal was to learn and apply:

- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model building & evaluation
- Predictive analytics

This repository contains example notebooks, scripts, and datasets that demonstrate the practical applications of machine learning.

## 🔹 Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, encoding categorical features, scaling, and normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends, correlations, and distributions using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Machine Learning Models:** 
  - Regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
  - Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
  - Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- **Predictions:** Making predictions on new data using trained models.
- **Documentation:** Well-commented code for learning and reproducibility.

## 🔹 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** 
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` for ML models
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook
